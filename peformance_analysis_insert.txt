INSERT:

To insert a node in the red-black tree, we need to search for the right position, which is O(logn), as seen in class. 
Then,inserting the node takes constant time.  Finally, we need to check that all of the red black tree rules are followed.
So, we need to check the color of parent node, check the "uncle" node, recolor 1-3 nodes, or do 1-2 rotations.
These all take constant time so the total runtime for intserion is O(log n).
