SEARCH:

To search the tree we start at the root and go to the leaves.  We do a constant comparison at each level
so the worst case cost of search() is the height of the tree if the item we are searching for is in a leaf level node
in the longest path of the tree.  Since in red black trees, the longest path is twice as long as the shortest path,
the worst case runtime for search is logn.
